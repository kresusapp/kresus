    This function tries to be smarter in detecting which of the provided
    transactions can safely be used to update the known transaction.
    when a pair of duplicate candidates transaction is detected, the known transaction
    can safely be updated if:
    - the known and provided transactions have all fields equal but the type
    AND one of the below conditions is verified:
    - the known transaction type is unknown and the provided one has a definite type
    - the transaction type has switched from DEFERRED_CARD_TYPE to TRANSACTION_CARD_TYPE,
      and the current date is after the transaction debitDate, as a deferred transaction
      can only become a "normal" transaction once its debit date is passed (a deferred transaction
      is by definition a transaction which debit date is in the future).
