; Hi there! This is the configuration file for
; Kresus. Please make sure to read all the options before setting up
; Kresus for the first time.
;
[kresus]

; This is where Kresus stores additional data, as the latest bank
; scrapping modules. It should be writeable by the user which launches
; the Kresus executable.
; Can be removed; defaults to HOME_DIR/.kresus.
; Overridden by the KRESUS_DIR environment variable, if it's set.
; Example:
; datadir=/home/ben/.kresus
datadir=

; A user id obtained from using the "kresus create-user" command.
; This allows sharing a single database with several users. If your
; instance is only planned to host a single user, you can keep it
; disabled, and Kresus will know how to automatically generate a new
; user.
; Overridden by the KRESUS_USER_ID environment variable, if it's set.
; Example:
; userid=1
userid=

; This is the port that Kresus will run on. It is recommended not
; to expose it on port 80 directly but to use a reverse-proxy
; configuration like Nginx, Caddy or Apache.
; Can be removed; defaults to 9876.
; Overridden by the PORT environment variable, if it's set.
; Example:
; port=9876
port=

; The host on which the Kresus server will listen to.
; Can be removed; defaults to 127.0.0.1.
; Overridden by the HOST environment variable, if it's set.
; Example:
; host=127.0.0.1
host=

; The executable version of Python that is going to get used when
; interacting with Python scripts. This can be python or python3.
; Can be removed; defaults to python3.
; Overridden by the KRESUS_PYTHON_EXEC environment variable, if it's set.
; Example:
; python_exec=python3
python_exec=

; The directory prefix in the URL, if Kresus is to be served from a
; subdirectory. For instance, if your website is hosted at example.com
; and the url prefix is "money", then Kresus will be reachable at
; example.com/money. By default, it's '', meaning that Kresus has its own
; subdomain.
; Can be removed; defaults to "".
; Overridden by the KRESUS_URL_PREFIX environment variable, if it's set.
; Example:
; url_prefix=/money
url_prefix=

; A salt value used in encryption algorithms (used for instance to
; encrypt/decrypt exports). It should be a random string value with
; at least 16 characters if you decide to provide it.
; Overridden by the KRESUS_SALT environment variable, if it's set.
; Example:
; salt=gj4J89fkjf4h29aDi0f{}fu4389sejk`9osk`
salt=

; Set this to true if you want to use this instance only in demo
; mode, and to never allow users to link their personal accounts.
;
; WARNING! Switching this on and off may trigger data loss. Note that it
; is still possible to try Kresus in demo mode, even if this is not set
; to true. Setting this to true will *force* demo mode, and prevent users
; from leaving this mode.
; Can be removed; defaults to false.
; Overridden by the KRESUS_FORCE_DEMO_MODE environment variable, if it's set.
; Example:
; force_demo_mode=true
force_demo_mode=

; If set to a string, will enable HTTP Basic Auth, by splitting the
; string on a colon, i.e. "<username>:<passwd>"

; that woob is already in the PYTHON_PATH (e.g. installed at the global
; level)
; Overridden by the KRESUS_WOOB_DIR environment variable, if it's set.
; Example:
; srcdir=/home/ben/code/woob
srcdir=

; Path to a file containing a valid Woob's source list directory.
; If empty (the default), indicates that Kresus will generate its own
; source list file and will store it in
; KRESUS_DIR/woob-data/sources.list.
; Overridden by the KRESUS_WOOB_SOURCES_LIST environment variable, if it's set.
; Example:
; sources_list=/home/ben/code/woob/sources.list
sources_list=

[email]

; The transport method you want to use. Can be either:

; dedicated configuration entries.

; Overridden by the KRESUS_EMAIL_TRANSPORT environment variable, if it's set.

[db]

; Database type supported by Kresus, to choose among:
; - postgres
; - sqlite
;
; It must be set by the user. PostgreSQL is recommended and strongly supported; your experience with other databases might vary.
;
; Note using sqlite is *strongly discouraged* because it can't properly handle certain kinds of database migrations. It is only intended for development purposes.

; type=sqlite
type=

; Logging level for the SQL queries. Possible values are:
